# How to Participate in A Miso Auction

_Please note that while the final form of the UI will continue to change, the primary functions, inputs and information can be expected to stay relatively similar. This page will be revised as we adapt our Auction pages._
_The Auction example used below is for explanatory purposes only. Token price, amount, auction duration, descriptors and the like are not indicative of any real auction._
**_Miso is permission-less and anyone can create an auction, Sushi is not responsible of the quality of the projects listed and we ask users to do proper research before investing in any auction!_**

Miso is currently available on Harmony and Ethereum network. When landing on the Miso home page you can see all the auctions currently live as well as the finished and upcoming ones. Browse though them and find the one you are interested in!

_In this example we will use the auction created in the previous guide (How to Create A Miso auction)._

Please take your time and do your due diligence before committing to any auction!

Once you feel confident that you have all the information needed and want to move forward with participating in the auction, scroll up and enter the amount of tokens you want to commit into the auction. Before being able to participate, you first will need to approve the auction contract (if spending ETH you will not need to approve), once done you can finally commit!
